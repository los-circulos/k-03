# k-03 fuel tank templates

Make a wooden template to bend your copper around when making fuel tanks for control line airplane models.

Apart from the general SVG file, a separate cut files are included with each design, ready to be burn cut (one for ply, and another optimized for balsa 100mm wide boards).
Material: 3mm plywood or balsa. Plywood makes a nice template to precisely bend copper. Balsa would have to be glassed from the inside and used as the fuel tank itself (NOTE: it will have ~10% less capacity like this, the exact difference varies based on the chosen design.

Designs:
- K 9 - 30mm wide, narrow top angle "doghouse".
- fatboy 10 - 38mm wide, low profile tank
- stunt 11 - 26mm wide, slim but tall "basic" design

Files provided for each design (substitute k_9 with preferred design name):
- tank-k_9-45cc.svg - main file for a 45cc tank
- tank-k_9-45cc-cut.svg - cut file for plywood
- tank-k_9-45cc-cut-100.svg - cut file for balsa (100mm wide board)
